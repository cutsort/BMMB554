      <description>RNAseq: Reference-based  This tutorial is inspired by an exceptional RNAseq course at the Weill Cornell Medical College compiled by Friederike Dündar, Luce Skrabanek, and Paul Zumbo and by tutorials produced by Björn Grüning (@bgruening) for Freiburg Galaxy instance. Much of Galaxy-related features described in this section have been developed by Björn Grüning (@bgruening) and configured by Dave Bouvier (@davebx).
 RNAseq can be roughly divided into two &amp;ldquo;types&amp;rdquo;:</description>

      <description>Calling varinats is complicated!
 Haploid systems Diploid system Finding really rare variants  Why call varinats? An example from Tibet Many residents of the Tibetian Plateau live above 4,000 meters where oxygen concentration is approximately 40% lower than at sea level:
 Tibetan Plateau and surrounding areas (from Wikipedia).
 Tibetian experience a number of adaptations to high altitudes manifesting in the following phenotypic differences:
 lower hemoglobin concentration Wu:2005 higher arterial oxygen saturation Niermeyer:1995 more efficient pulmonary gas exchange Zhuang:1996  What are the genetic causes of these adaptations?</description>
